            <h3>Hudsonville, MI Insights: Population,
                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>Hudsonville was platted in 1873, soon after the Chicago and West Michigan Railway was extended to that point. The town was named for Homer E. Hudson, a pioneer settler, who was also the town's first postmaster. The early settlement of Hudsonville was next to a swamp, which hampered early development. In 1872, construction of the Chicago and West Michigan Railroad was completed. The railroad brought more settlers to the area, including many Dutch immigrants.</p>
