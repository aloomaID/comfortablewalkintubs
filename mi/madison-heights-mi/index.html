                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>Originally part of Royal Oak Township, Madison Heights incorporated as a city by popular vote on January 17, 1955, and chartered on December 6 of that same year, becoming the tenth city government in southern Oakland County. At that time, the 7.2 square miles (18.6 km2) city was one of the largest suburban communities in the Metro Detroit area. The first city hall was at 26305 John R Road, the former township offices. On April 5, 1963, a new municipal building was dedicated which is on the present location at 300 West Thirteen Mile Road. The city lies in the Interstate 696 (I-696) and I-75 corridor and is served by two primary school districts, Lamphere and Madison, as well as a full-service municipal government.</p>
